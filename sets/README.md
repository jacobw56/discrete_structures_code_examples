# Set Examples

Set examples using built-in or standard library structures.

Building and running the C++ example is easy using `gcc` (Mac, Linux, Windows with WSL, etc.)

```[bash]
g++ sets.cpp -o sets
./sets
```

If you have `python` version 3+ installed, you can run the python example using

```[bash]
python3 sets.py
```
